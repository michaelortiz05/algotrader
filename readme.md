# Outback Algorithmic Trader

Outback algorithmic trader is an exploratory project by Joshua Head and Michael Ortiz. The goal is to learn the basics of algorithmic trading strategies, not to make significant profits.

## Setup
At this point in the project's development, the only required module is the alpaca trading api and its dependent libraries. Though a Jupyter notebook is currently being used, this will most likely not be the case in the future.

- Clone repo
- Ask for auth.json :)
- install alpaca api (virtual environment suggested): "pip install alpaca-trade-api"
